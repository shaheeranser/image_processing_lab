# Image Processing and Analysis Labs

This repository is from the 'Image Processing and Analysis - Lab' module at my University.

## Working with the code

- Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv .venv`.
- Run the virtual environment using `source .venv/bin/activate` if on linux, on other operating systems the command is slightly different.
- Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Create and populate an `images` directory.
- You can now run the jupyter notebooks/python scripts; make sure the image paths match the ones defined in the notebooks/scripts.

> **Important Note:** The repository was created and worked upon on a device running Linux (Fedora); due to some peculiar behavior of python libraries on different platforms, there might be some different behaviors if the code is run 'as is' on Windows, Mac, or another Linux distro. If you encounter an error when running a notebook/script, kindly look into the source code for any such snippets or the lack thereoff.
