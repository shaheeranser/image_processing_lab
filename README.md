# Image Processing and Analysis Labs

This repository is from the 'Image Processing and Analysis - Lab' module at my University.

## How to set up

- Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv .venv`.
- Run the virtual environment using `source .venv/bin/activate` if on linux, on other operating systems the command is slightly different.
- Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Create and populate an `images` directory.
- You can now run the jupyter notebooks; make sure the image paths match the ones defined in the notebooks.
